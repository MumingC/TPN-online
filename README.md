# TPN online
TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) is frequently used in Intensive Care Unit of the hospital. In neonate and children, it is especially important to manage sugar infusion rate (SIR) and total daily fluid carefully to avoid hypoglycemia or fluid imbalance

Using this calculator, one can quickly calculate the SIR and total daily fluid, and save time from using the calculator repeatedly for a perfect match of flow rate and glucose concentration.

## Formula used in this calculator
* SIR = flow rate (cc/hr) * glucose concentration (%) / (6 * Bodyweight (kg))
* Total daily fluid = flow rate (cc/hr) * 24 hours
